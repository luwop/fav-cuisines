        "description": "Explore popular language features, Java to Kotlin interoperability, advanced topics, and practical applications by building a variety of sample projects Key Features Understand and leverage the syntax, tools, and patterns by writing code in Kotlin Explore practical topics such as Java interop, concurrency with coroutines, and functional programming Discover how to use Kotlin for build targets like Android, iOS, JavaScript, and backend service Book Description Using Kotlin without taking advantage of its power and interoperability is like owning a sports car and never taking it out of the garage. While documentation and introductory resources can help you learn the basics of Kotlin, the fact that it’s a new language means that there are limited learning resources and code bases available in comparison to Java and other established languages. This Kotlin book will show you how to leverage software designs and concepts that have made Java the most dominant enterprise programming language. You’ll understand how Kotlin is a modern approach to object-oriented programming (OOP). This book will take you through the vast array of features that Kotlin provides over other languages. These features include seamless interoperability with Java, efficient syntax, built-in functional programming constructs, and support for creating your own DSL. Finally, you will gain an understanding of implementing practical design patterns and best practices to help you master the Kotlin language. By the end of the book, you'll have obtained an advanced understanding of Kotlin in order to be able to build production-grade applications. What you will learn Model data using interfaces, classes, and data classes Grapple with practical interoperability challenges and solutions with Java Build parallel apps using concurrency solutions such as coroutines Explore functional, reactive, and imperative programming to build flexible apps Discover how to build your own domain-specific language Embrace functional programming using the standard library and Arrow Delve into the use of Kotlin for frontend JavaScript development Build server-side services using Kotlin and Ktor Who this book is for If you’re a Kotlin developer looking to further their skills or a professional Java developer looking for better or professional resources in order to make a switch to Kotlin, this book is for you. Familiarity with Kotlin programming will assist with understanding key concepts covered in the book.",

        "description": "Master the concise and expressive power of a pragmatic, multi-paradigm language for JVM, Android and beyond DESCRIPTION The purpose of this book is to guide a reader through the capabilities of Kotlin language and give examples of how to use it for the development of various applications, be it desktop, mobile or Web. Although our primary focus is on JVM and Android, the knowledge we’re sharing here, to various extents, applies to other Kotlin-supported platforms such as JavaScript, native and even multi-platform applications. The book starts with an introduction to the language and its ecosystem, which will give you an understanding of the key ideas behind the Kotlin design, introduce you to the Kotlin tooling and present you the basic language syntax and constructs. In the next chapters, we get to know the multi-paradigm nature of Kotlin which allows us to create powerful abstractions by combining various aspects of functional and object-oriented programming. We’ll talk about using common Kotlin APIs, such as the standard library, reflection, and coroutine-based concurrency as well as the means for creating your own flexible APIs based on domain-specific languages. In the concluding chapters, we give examples of using Kotlin for more specialized tasks, such as testing, building Android applications, Web development and creating microservices. KEY FEATURES ● Language fundamentals ● Object-oriented and functional programming with Kotlin ● Kotlin standard library ● Building domain-specific languages ● Using Kotlin for Web development ● Kotlin for Android platform ● Coroutine-based concurrency WHAT WILL YOU LEARN By the end of the book you’ll obtain a thorough knowledge of all the basic aspects of Kotlin programming. You’ll be able to create a flexible and reusable code by taking advantage of object-oriented and functional features, use Kotlin standard library, compose your own domain-specific languages, write asynchronous code using Kotlin coroutines library as well. You’ll also have a basic understanding of using Kotlin for writing test code, web applications and Android development. This knowledge will also give you a solid foundation for deeper learning of related development platforms, tools, and frameworks. WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR The book is primarily aimed at developers who are familiar with Java and JVM and are willing to get a firm understanding of Kotlin while having little to no experience in that language. Discussion of various language features will be accompanied, if deemed necessary, by comparisons with their Java’s analogs, which should simplify the Java-to-Kotlin transition. Most of the material, however, is rather Java-agnostic and should be beneficial even without prior knowledge of Java. In general, experience in object-oriented or functional paradigm is a plus, but not required. Table of Contents 1. Kotlin: Powerful and Pragmatic 2. Language Fundamentals 3. Defining Functions 4.

If you're an experienced Java developer who has tried the Kotlin language, you were probably productive in about the same time. You'll have found that they do things differently in Kotlin, though. Nullability is important, collections are different, and classes are final by default. Kotlin is more functional, but what does that mean, and how should it change the way that you program? And what about all that Java code that you still have to support? Your tour guides Duncan and Nat first made the trip in 2015, and they've since helped many teams and individuals follow in their footsteps. Travel with them as they break the route down into legs like Optional to Nullable, Beans to Values, and Open to Sealed Classes. Each explains a key concept and then shows how to refactor production Java to idiomatic Kotlin, gradually and safely, while maintaining interoperability. The resulting code is simpler, more expressive, and easier to change. By the end of the journey, you'll be confident in refactoring Java to Kotlin, writing Kotlin from scratch, and managing a mixed language codebase as it evolves over time.",

Reusing design patterns helps prevent complex issues that can cause major problems, improves your code base, promotes code reuse, and makes an architecture more robust. The mission of this book is to ease the adoption of design patterns in Kotlin and provide good practices for programmers. The book begins by showing you the practical aspects of smarter coding in Kotlin, explaining the basic Kotlin syntax and the impact of design patterns. From there, the book provides an in-depth explanation of the classical design patterns of creational, structural, and behavioral families, before heading into functional programming. It then takes you through reactive and concurrent patterns, teaching you about using streams, threads, and coroutines to write better code along the way By the end of the book, you will be able to efficiently address common problems faced while developing applications and be comfortable working on scalable and maintainable projects of any size. What you will learn Get to grips with Kotlin principles, including its strengths and weaknesses Understand classical design patterns in Kotlin Explore functional programming using built-in features of Kotlin Solve real-world problems using reactive and concurrent design patterns Use threads and coroutines to simplify concurrent code flow Understand antipatterns to write clean Kotlin code, avoiding common pitfalls Learn about the design considerations necessary while choosing between architectures Who this book is for This book is for developers who would like to master design patterns with Kotlin to build efficient and scalable applications.
